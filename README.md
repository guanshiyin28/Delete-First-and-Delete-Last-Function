# Delete First and Delete Last Function

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive starting point for understanding and implementing two fundamental list operations: deleting the first element and deleting the last element. These operations are implemented in Python and serve as a great introduction to list manipulation for beginners and intermediate programmers.

<hr><br>

## Purpose of This Repository

### Deleting the First Element

Deleting the first element of a list is a basic operation that involves removing the element at the beginning of the list and shifting all subsequent elements one position to the left. This repository provides examples of how to perform this operation efficiently in Python.

### Deleting the Last Element

Deleting the last element of a list is another essential operation that involves removing the element at the end of the list. This operation is straightforward and is commonly used in various programming tasks. This repository includes examples of how to handle this operation in Python.
