## Purpose of This Repository

### Deleting the First Element
Deleting the first element of a list is a basic operation that involves removing the element at the beginning of the list and shifting all subsequent elements one position to the left. This repository provides examples of how to perform this operation efficiently in Python.

### Deleting the Last Element
Deleting the last element of a list is another essential operation that involves removing the element at the end of the list. This operation is straightforward and is commonly used in various programming tasks. This repository includes examples of how to handle this operation in Python.
